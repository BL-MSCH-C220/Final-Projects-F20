# Escape-The-Submarine
MSCH-C220 Game Jame, December 2020

##	Theme
We knew going into the theme reveal that we wanted to create a point and click escape game like the old flash games online.

After the theme 'Under Pressure' was revealed, we knew immediately that it would be a timed escape (in our case 3 minutes) and in order to further iterate the theme, we chose the setting to be a submarine.

While there is no visual readout in the game's UI, the music played in the background serves to inform the player of when they have allotted most of their time, and then that their life will very soon come to an end with the fast paced drum beats.

##	Game play
Objective: Escape the Submarine in the given amount of time (3 minutes) by solving various puzzles which have been arranged in a linear fashion
Game-play instructions: Click on either the left or right of the screen to navigate about the submarine. If you are in a 'close up scene' (chest, hatch or locker) you can click at the bottom to return to the respective parent scene

##	Impediments
Our team worked incredibly together and communicated well throughout the length of the 48 hours, it was incredible to experience a group project where every member is equally invested and willing to give their full attention

The only Impediments we encountered were in the last stages of development while testing for bugs, they were able to be quickly solved though and have been eliminated from the current version of the game

##	Implementation
Features: Point and Click gameplay, Music, and Sound Effects
Assets, or resources used: All resources were drawn by hand and colored or shaded in Adobe Photoshop

##	Future Development
