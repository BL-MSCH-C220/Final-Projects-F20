# Metal-Shoes-Final-Project
 MSCH-C220, December 3, 2020

## Theme
We interpreted the theme as being stuck in a crumbling lab trying to get out as fast as possible

## Gameplay
Get out of the lab as fast as possible
Use WASD to move 

## Impediments
We all had issues getting GitHub to work for all of us.  There were also issues with the animation sprite sheet, getting levels to connect, and some of the display things disappearing. 

## Implementation
Created in Godot 3.2.2
